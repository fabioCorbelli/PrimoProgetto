JSON (JavaScript Object Notation, pronounced /'d?e?s?n/; also /'d?e??s?n/) is an open standard file format, 
and data interchange format, that uses human-readable text to store and transmit data objects consisting of attribute–value pairs 
and array data types (or any other serializable value). 
It is a very common data format, with a diverse range of applications, such as serving as a replacement for XML in AJAX systems.[1]

JSON is a language-independent data format. 
It was derived from JavaScript, but many modern programming languages include code to generate and parse JSON-format data. 
The official Internet media type for JSON is application/json. 
JSON filenames use the extension .json.

Douglas Crockford originally specified the JSON format in the early 2000s. 
After RFC 4627 had been available as its "informational" specification since 2006, 
JSON was first standardized in 2013, as ECMA-404.[2] RFC 8259, 
published in 2017, is the current version of the Internet Standard STD 90, 
and it remains consistent with ECMA-404.[3] 
That same year, JSON was also standardized as ISO/IEC 21778:2017.[4] 
The ECMA and ISO standards describe only the allowed syntax, whereas the RFC covers some security and interoperability considerations.[5]
